Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) provide a more granular level of file and directory permissions than the standard owner/group/others model. Here's how you can work with ACLs in RHEL.

### Step 1: Check if ACL is Supported

Most modern filesystems support ACLs, but you can confirm if it's enabled on your filesystem. Use the following command to check:

```bash
mount | grep acl
```

If ACL is not enabled, you can enable it by editing the `/etc/fstab` file. For example:

1. Open `/etc/fstab`:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/fstab
   ```

2. Add `acl` to the mount options of your filesystem. For example:

   ```
   /dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults,acl 0 1
   ```

3. Remount the filesystem:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -o remount /
   ```

### Step 2: Install Required Tools

If the ACL tools are not already installed, you can install them using:

```bash
sudo yum install acl
```

### Step 3: Set ACLs

You can set ACLs using the `setfacl` command. The syntax is as follows:

```bash
setfacl -m [user:username:permissions] file/directory
```

#### Example

To give user `bob` read and write permissions on a file called `example.txt`, use:

```bash
setfacl -m u:bob:rw example.txt
```

### Step 4: View ACLs

To view the ACLs of a file or directory, use the `getfacl` command:

```bash
getfacl example.txt
```

### Step 5: Remove ACLs

To remove an ACL entry, use the `setfacl` command with the `-x` option:

```bash
setfacl -x u:bob example.txt
```

### Step 6: Default ACLs

You can also set default ACLs for directories, which will apply to newly created files within that directory:

```bash
setfacl -m d:u:bob:rw directory_name
```

### Step 7: Verify

You can verify that your ACLs are set correctly by using:

```bash
getfacl example.txt
```

### Additional Notes

- **Permissions**: ACL permissions can include read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`).
- **Groups**: You can also set group ACLs using the same syntax: `g:groupname:permissions`.
- **Mask**: The mask defines the maximum permissions that can be granted to users and groups. You can view and set it using `setfacl -m m:permissions`.
