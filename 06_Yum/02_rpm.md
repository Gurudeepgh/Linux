`rpm` (Red Hat Package Manager) and `yum` (Yellowdog Updater Modified) are both package management tools used in RPM-based Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, and Fedora. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities.

### RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)

- **Purpose**: `rpm` is a low-level package management tool that allows you to install, uninstall, and manage RPM packages directly. It does not resolve dependencies automatically.

- **Basic Commands**:
  - **Install a Package**:
    ```bash
    rpm -ivh package.rpm
    ```
  - **Remove a Package**:
    ```bash
    rpm -e package_name
    ```
  - **Query Installed Packages**:
    ```bash
    rpm -q package_name
    ```
  - **List All Installed Packages**:
    ```bash
    rpm -qa
    ```
  - **Verify a Package**:
    ```bash
    rpm -V package_name
    ```

- **Limitations**: One of the main drawbacks of `rpm` is that it does not automatically handle dependencies. If a package requires other packages to be installed, you must resolve and install those dependencies manually.

### YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified)

- **Purpose**: `yum` is a higher-level package management tool that works on top of `rpm`. It simplifies package management by automatically handling dependencies, managing repositories, and providing an easier command syntax for users.

- **Basic Commands**:
  - **Install a Package**:
    ```bash
    yum install package_name
    ```
  - **Remove a Package**:
    ```bash
    yum remove package_name
    ```
  - **Update a Package**:
    ```bash
    yum update package_name
    ```
  - **Update All Packages**:
    ```bash
    yum update
    ```
  - **Search for a Package**:
    ```bash
    yum search package_name
    ```
  - **List Installed Packages**:
    ```bash
    yum list installed
    ```
  - **Get Package Information**:
    ```bash
    yum info package_name
    ```

- **Advantages**:
  - **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolves and installs dependencies for the requested package.
  - **Repository Management**: Uses configured repositories to fetch packages, ensuring that you get the latest versions.
  - **Group Installations**: Supports installing groups of related packages easily.

### Using RPM Packages with YUM

While `yum` primarily works with packages in repositories, it can also manage local RPM files. Hereâ€™s how you can use `yum` with RPM packages:

1. **Install a Local RPM File**:
   You can use `yum` to install a local RPM package, which will also attempt to resolve any dependencies:

   ```bash
   yum localinstall package.rpm
   ```

   This command is useful because `yum` will check the available repositories for any dependencies needed by the RPM file you're installing.

2. **Upgrade a Package Using a Local RPM File**:
   You can also upgrade an existing package with a local RPM file:

   ```bash
   yum upgrade package.rpm
   ```

### Summary

- **`rpm`**: A low-level tool for managing RPM packages directly without automatic dependency resolution.
- **`yum`**: A high-level tool that simplifies package management, automatically resolving dependencies and managing repositories.

Using `yum` is generally recommended for most users because it simplifies the installation and management of software, while `rpm` is useful for specific cases where you need direct control over individual RPM files.
